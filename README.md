<h1 align="center">E-commerce Consumer Behavior Analysis</h1>

## Introduction:
This project analyzes consumer behavior patterns in an e-commerce environment to identify key trends and optimize marketing strategies. This is an analysis of the purchasing patterns, consumer demographics and various engagement metrics.

## Business Task & Objectives:

 Using Excel, we explore and answer key business questions such as but not limited to: 
- How can we segment customers based on their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) profiles?
- What factors most influence purchasing behavior?
- How do different consumer demographics influence purchasing behavior?
- What factors contribute most to customer loyalty and engagement?
- What is the relationship between research efficacy and conversion rates?
- Statistical analysis of consumer behavior patterns

The dataset includes comprehensive information on customer transactions, demographics, purchasing patterns, and engagement metrics.

## RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis

<img src= https://github.com/AndyeliSays/Ecommerce-Customer-Behavior/blob/main/assets/Ecommerce_Rfm_snapshot.png>
The RFM trend analysis demonstrates that targeting mid-value customers may yield better returns than exclusively focusing on the highest-value segments.
- * There is no direct linear relationship between higher RFM scores and revenue; instead, the mid-range scores (200-400 range) represent the revenue sweet spot.
- Lower to mid-range RFM scores generate the highest revenue, with scores like 211 ($11,257.18), 222 ($9,224.49), and 412 ($8,477.41) leading in revenue contribution.
- The majority of revenue comes from customers with moderate recency, frequency, and monetary values rather than from the highest-scoring customers.
- Customer distribution is more heavily weighted toward mid-range RFM scores, with relatively few customers in the highest scores (500+ range).
- As RFM scores increase to the highest levels (500+), both customer count and revenue decrease, with scores like 555 generating only $57.50 from a single customer.
